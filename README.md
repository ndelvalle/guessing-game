# guessing-game

This game was made using the [chapter two](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html#guessing-game) of the second edition of the Rust book tutorial.

Hereâ€™s how it works: The program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After entering a guess, it will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print congratulations and exit.


## Build
